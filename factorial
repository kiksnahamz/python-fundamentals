n = 5
#initialize factorial variable to 1
factorial = 1

#use integer function to find n
#the for loop iterates through the range from 1, up to, but not including n+1

'''so as we iterate through the loop factorial stores the factorials ascending
first its 1*1
then factorial holds a value of 1
then it is multiplied by the next i in the range
so 1*2, factorial holds the number 2 for the next iteration
then on the next iteration it is multiplied by 3 and holds the value of 6
it continues in this manner until the last multiplication where 5 is multiplied by 4!

        factorial = factorial * i
